## Objectives
* Understand more rails TDD with Rspec
* Implement some more forms with [simple_form](https://github.com/plataformatec/simple_form)
* Understand routing
* Understand `resources` routing

## The day's ongoing exercise
* Add Departures to [bart schedules app](https://github.com/wdi-sf-september-2014/bart_schedules) - test driven of course
	* Note: it's a 1-M relationship (Station has many Departures)
* Implement the rest of the requirements of the app

## Homework

Thinking about the relationship between Stations and Departures differently

* Implement an M-M relationship between Stations and Departures

Bonuses

* Implement a station filter to only display departures for a specific station
* Implement the functionality to be able to navigate the stations via next and previous buttons. The way you do this from a ui perspective is up to you.
